# Crypto-prediction-

The popularity of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 due to several consecutive months of exponential growth of their market capitalization. The prices peaked at more than $800 billion in January 2018.
Although machine learning has been successful in predicting stock market prices through a host of different time series models, its application in predicting cryptocurrency prices has been quite restrictive. The reason behind this is obvious as prices of cryptocurrencies depend on a lot of factors like technological progress, internal competition, pressure on the markets to deliver, economic problems, security issues, political factor etc. Their high volatility leads to the great potential of high profit if intelligent inventing strategies are taken. Unfortunately, due to their lack of indexes, cryptocurrencies are relatively unpredictable compared to traditional financial predictions like stock market prediction.
We will be going through a four step process to predict cryptocurrency prices:
Getting real-time crptocurrency data.
Prepare data for training and testing.
Predict the price of crptocurrency using LSTM neural network.
Visualize the prediction results.

Data
The dataset can be downloaded from the CryptoCompare website which can be found here.
The dataset contains total of 5 features. The details for them are as follows:
Close Price — It is the market close price for currency for that particular day.
High Price — It is highest price of currency for the day.
Low Price — It is the lowest price for currency for that day.
Open Price — It is market open price for currency for that day.
Volume — The volume of currency that is being in trade for that day.
